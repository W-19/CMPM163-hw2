I got the cat model from a friend who's taking CMPS 160 with James Davis- I hope that's alright. I wanted a cool skybox so I got one from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/spaceskies-free-80503. The noise texture I used for my height map is an edited photo of my room's ceiling, and I added a couple of parameters so I could make it appear similar to the terrain in class. The Simple Water object is there because I was having trouble setting the alpha on my normal (reflective) Water object at first - I'm leaving it in mostly as a reference for myself. Said reflective water only reflects/refracts the skybox right now - I'm not sure how to get it to refract the terrain. The water also seems to not render in the project view from certain distances- if you encounter this problem, just zoom in/out.

Both executables are for Mac.
